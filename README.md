# Android Toolbelt
*A Scala on Android library*

An Android library project providing essential helpers

**Install**

This project is an Android library project meaning that you have to clone and reference it by yourself.

**Features**

The source is currently lacking of documentation as it is primary intended for personal use. The library's main features are:

- Common implicit conversions (`import com.taig.android._`)
- WallpaperService wrapper to clean up the mess of an API Google is providing
- Color picker preference
